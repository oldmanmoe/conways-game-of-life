## About This Project
This is my **first solo project**! I am building this to practice my logic and programming skills by implementing one of the most famous examples of cellular automata: **Conway's Game of Life**. I've always been fascinated with the way CGoL looks. Something about how abstract and chaotic it can be, but also, if you put enough efort in to finding certain combintions, it can give life to the most beautiful patterns.

## What is Conway's Game of Life?
Created by mathematician John Conway in 1970, it's not a "game" in the traditional sense with players. Instead, it is a **zero-player game**. 

Its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. You set up a "grid" of cells, and they live, die, or multiply based on four simple rules:

1.  **Underpopulation:** Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies.
2.  **Survival:** Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
3.  **Overpopulation:** Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies.
4.  **Reproduction:** Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell.

## Tech Stack
